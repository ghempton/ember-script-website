# EmberScript
## Ember.js-Infused CoffeeScript

EmberScript is a [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) derived language that has first-class support for the [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/) runtime. It also has all of the syntactical goodness of the original Coffeescript, compiles directly into JavaScript, and can be used outside of Ember applications! Because EmberScript is also a compiled language, really cool things such as compile-time property dependency inference are possible.

*EmberScript on the left, JavaScript on the right. All examples are editable!*

<%= example 'main' %>

### Installation

Being as EmberScript is still in early development, it is best to install via npm from git. After installing [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), run the following command:

```
sudo npm install -g 'git://github.com/ghempton/ember-script.git#HEAD'
ember-script --help
```

To use EmberScript inside of a Rails application through the asset pipeline, see [ember-script-rails](https://github.com/ghempton/ember-script-rails).

### Language Reference

For basic CoffeeScript syntax, please consult the [CoffeeScript reference](http://coffeescript.org/)

#### Object Model

EmberScript replaces the CoffeeScript object model with Ember's:

<%= example 'object_model' %>

#### Computed Properties and Observers

<%= example 'properties' %>

#### Dependency Inference

<%= example 'inference' %>

#### Properties and Accessors

<%= example 'accessors' %>
